# React_Snake_Game

This is a personal project where I developed a classic Snake game using React.js without HTML Canvas. The game features intuitive controls, dynamic gameplay, and a simple yet engaging interface. Players can navigate the snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own tail.
